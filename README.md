# DMA Tool for windows
### About
This is a project im developing to learn more about reverse engineering and to get better at c++.
### More info
If you dont have a DMA device and want to test out this tool you can comment out "#define USING_DMA" in Memory.h, this will make the tool use the windows api instead.
